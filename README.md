# hello-world
This is a trial repository during training. Это пробный репозитарий во время обучения. 
This is a sample tutorial file.
In the future, I want to make a site that will be useful to people. I have extensive experience in compiling pedigrees. It is not difficult to create pedigrees for your children and grandchildren on the website. Present your child with a beautifully designed pedigree for his birthday or New Year.
Also on the site we will define what a "family pedigree" is.
